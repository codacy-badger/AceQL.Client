                    Version 2.0
                    Release Notes


Introduction
------------

The SDK allows to wrap the AceQL HTTP APIs and 
eliminate the tedious works of handling communications errors and parsing 
JSON results.

C# application developers can access remote SQL databases and/or SQL databases 
in the cloud by simply including standard C# SQL calls in their code, just like 
they would do for an SQL Server database.
