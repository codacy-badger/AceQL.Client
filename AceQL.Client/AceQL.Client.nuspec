        <description>This version is designed to operate with AceQL HTTP v2.0, v2.1, v3.0 or v3.1 on server  side. 
		It now fully supports stored procedure calls on MS SQL Server (and also on MySQL, PostgreSQL and Oracle).
		AceQL HTTP Server v2.1+ is required for stored procedure calls.
		Note that this version is not compatible with AceQL HTTP v1.0 server side.

        <releaseNotes>
		Trace default was on. This would slow down execution. This has been fixed: trace default status is off.
		Trace management was static: there was only one trace file for all threads. This has been fixed: there is
		now one trace file per thread.
